# CS-210
Programming Languages. Using C++ and Python

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The purpose of this project was to create a grocery tracking program that allowed the user to see a list of purchased items and how many times each item was purchased. The program also allows you to search a specific item and see how many times that item was purchased. Lastly, the program shows a histogram of all the purchased items in order to provide a visual for the end user. The purpose of this project was to successfully combine C++ and Python functions together.
  
# What did you do particularly well?
  I felt I did well at making a succinct user input menu
  
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could enhance this code by including exception handling around the user input section
  
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most challenging code to write for me in this assignment was the python function to write to a new file. I have been learning C++ this term and only had one Python course so going back to Python was the challenging part and not confusing it with C++ syntax. I now understand it clearly, I just need more practice with both languages. Both the Python and C++ websites are full of useful information.
  
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  An important takeaway from this assignment was combining Python and C++ and calling functions between the both of them. This will be transferable to many projects in the future.
  
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Using OOP practices by keeping main() as clean as possible. I was able to write seperate functions for the user menu, reading files, etc.. By ceating these functions and then only having to call the menu function in main(), it keeps the code clear and maintainable.
